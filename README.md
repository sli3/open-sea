# open-sea: My Homelab Docker Compose Files

Welcome to the `open-sea` repository! Here you'll find the Docker Compose files I use to manage the various services and applications running in my personal homelab setup.

## Purpose

The primary goals of this repository are to:

* **Share my working Docker Compose configurations:** I'll be sharing the exact Docker Compose files that power my homelab environment.
* **Assist others in learning Docker Compose:** I hope these real-world examples can be a valuable learning resource for individuals new to Docker Compose or those seeking practical configurations for their own homelabs. By examining these files, you can understand how different services are defined, linked, and managed.
* **Provide a foundation for your own homelab:** Feel free to take these files, adapt them to your specific needs, and build your own homelab environment. They might save you significant time and effort in setting up common applications.

## Contents

Within this `open-sea` repository, you will find Docker Compose files, potentially organized by category or the specific service they manage. Expect to find configurations for services such as:

* **Media Servers:** (e.g., Plex, Jellyfin, Emby)
* **Download Clients:** (e.g., qBittorrent, Transmission)
* **Home Automation:** (e.g., Home Assistant, Node-RED)
* **Network Services:** (e.g., Pi-hole, AdGuard Home)
* **Databases:** (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL)
* **Utility Tools:** (e.g., Portainer, Traefik/Nginx Proxy Manager)
* ...and more as my homelab evolves!

**Please Note:** The structure and the specific files available in this repository will be updated as my homelab setup changes and grows.

## How to Use These Files

1.  **Explore the repository:** Browse the different directories and files to locate the Docker Compose configuration relevant to the service you're interested in.
2.  **Examine the `docker-compose.yml` (and any `.env` files):** Carefully review the contents of the `docker-compose.yml` file to understand:
    * The defined services
    * The Docker images being used for each service
    * The environment variables required
    * The port mappings between the container and your host machine
    * The volume mounts for persistent data
    * Any network configurations
3.  **Customize for your setup:**
    * **Environment Variables:** Many configurations rely on environment variables, often defined in a separate `.env` file (you might find a `.env.example` which you should rename and modify). **It's crucial to create a `.env` file (if provided as an example) and adjust the values to match your specific environment.** This includes paths to your data storage, API keys, usernames, passwords, etc.
    * **Volume Paths:** Update the paths specified in the `volumes` section to reflect the correct locations on your host machine where you want the application data to be stored.
    * **Port Mappings:** Modify the port mappings (e.g., `80:80`) if the default ports conflict with other services already running on your network.
    * **Network Configuration:** Adjust network settings if you have a custom network setup.
4.  **Deploy the services:** Once you have customized the files, navigate to the directory containing the `docker-compose.yml` file in your terminal and execute the following command:

    ```bash
    docker-compose up -d
    ```

    This command will download the necessary Docker images (if they are not already present locally) and start the containers in detached mode (running in the background).
5.  **Access your services:** After the containers are running, you should be able to access the deployed services using the specified ports and the IP address of your Docker host.

## Important Considerations

* **Security First:** Always be aware of the security implications when exposing services to your local network or the wider internet. Ensure you understand the configurations and implement appropriate security measures.
* **Data Persistence is Key:** The Docker Compose files will typically define volumes to ensure that your application data persists even when containers are stopped or restarted. Understand where this data is being stored on your host system.
* **Service Dependencies:** Some services might depend on other services. The `docker-compose.yml` files will usually define these links, but it's important to be aware of these dependencies.
* **Keep Up-to-Date:** Docker images are frequently updated with bug fixes and new features. Regularly check the upstream image repositories for new versions and consider updating your containers accordingly.
* **Implement Backups:** These Docker Compose files handle the deployment and management of your services, but they do not handle backups. It's essential to implement a separate backup strategy for your important application data.

## Contributing (Optional)

While this repository primarily serves as a showcase of my personal homelab configuration, if you have suggestions, improvements, or identify any errors, please feel free to:

* **Open an issue:** Report any problems you encounter or suggest potential enhancements.
* **Submit a pull request:** If you have a specific change or a new Docker Compose file that you believe would be valuable to others, don't hesitate to submit a pull request.

## Disclaimer

Please remember that these configurations are tailored to my specific homelab environment. While I aim to provide clear and functional examples, I cannot guarantee they will work flawlessly in every setup. Use these files at your own risk.

## Thank You!

Thank you for visiting the `open-sea` repository! I hope you find these Docker Compose files useful and that they help you navigate the waters of your own homelab journey. Happy containerizing!
